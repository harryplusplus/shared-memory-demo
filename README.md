# Shared Memory Game Server Status Monitoring Demo

This demo illustrates how to monitor the real-time status of a game server using **POSIX Shared Memory**. In this demonstration, We monitor a **pseudo** `user_count` that increments by one with each server tick.

## Purpose and Utility of this Demo

This approach is particularly useful in environments where **IO resource efficiency is critical, such as game servers**. By sharing status information through direct **memory access** rather than traditional IO operations, more resources can be dedicated to the core functionalities of the game server.

For instance, this can be effectively used to monitor a variety of server metrics like current connected users, RPC calls per minute, or overall server load.

## Lock-Free Status Monitoring (Dirty Read)

For status values that can be represented within a **single word size (e.g., `u32`, `u64`, `usize`)**, you can achieve safe read/write operations without the need for traditional locks like **Mutexes**, by utilizing **Atomic Operations or `volatile` memory accesses**.

While this involves what is sometimes referred to as a "Dirty Read", it ensures that single-word writes and reads are atomic at the hardware level. This minimizes data inconsistencies and allows for **maximum performance**.
